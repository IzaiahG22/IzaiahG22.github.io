	<h1>Internet Humor</h1>
        <p>The internet is a great venue for humor.  I will add some links to a couple different things across the interent that can make me laugh and hopefully you can also find some value from them.</p>

      <h2>Youtube Laughs</h2>
      <p>When I think of the internet and laughing, the first thing that comes to mind is Youtube "try not to laugh" compluations.</p>

       <h2>Laughs for the Commute</h2>
        <p>Sometimes I get tired of music and want to switch it up. Podcasts are can be a great listen and a good laugh for the commute or even just to listen too. I will add a podcast I listen too for some good laughs, although fair warning, it can be some pretty dark/raunchy humor.</p>

        <h2>Yo Momma Jokes</h2>
        <p>May be a little corny, but as a kid, me and my cousins/brothers were always telling your momma jokes. If you are runnning low, I am going to add a hyperlink of some of the best your momma jokes on the internet</p>
