      <h2>How to Play</h2>
      <p>A player will start and if you make a ball you keep going. Whoever makes the second ball either stripes or solids is what you must hit the rest of the game. Whoever can make all of their balls firt wins.</p>
      <li>As you can see, once all the balls are made you will be promoted with a screen to restart another game or go back home.</li>

      <li>I personally always go for stripes, either way once you get all of the stripes or solid balls in. You just need to make the black ball to win the game.</li>
      <li>You can keep playing over and over. Once you finish a game, simply restart and play another one.</li>
      <li>You can also change if you want to switch from 2D to 3D 8ball, and 3D looks much more visually pleasing.</li>

              <th>After the break and each player has a designated ball type. Find your angles and get those balls in the pockets!</th>
              <th>When trying to make your designated balls in the pockets, make sure you do not hit the white ball in, as it will end your turn and give your opponent the option to place the white ball wherever he sees fit.</th>
              <th>Once you have made all of your balls, simply socre the 8ball without scratching and you have won yourself the game.</th>
