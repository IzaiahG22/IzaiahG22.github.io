<h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
<p>A hero is someone that we look up to. A hero is anyone that any body looks up to. A hero is someone who embody's your beliefs and values. Somebody that strives for success in the face of struggles.</p>
<p>Emmitt Smith in my humble oponion is the greatest running back of all time, if not, one of the best. He is the currently leader of career rushing yards in the NFL. He played 13 seasons with the Dallas Cowboys and 2 seasons with the Arizona Cardinals. </p>
